            It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth.
             I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
              I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

            I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine

            When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!

            That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.

            We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

            Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.

            The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.
